## How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?
**Much lower drive frequency than natural frequency**
  * Pendulum will have a __slow__ driving force
      * Small amplitude of oscillation
      * Pendulum can adjust because of the slow drive changes

**Much higher drive frequency than natural frequency** 
  * Very _small_ motion from the pendulum
    * There's a rapid oscillation of the drive
    * Too much inertia for the pendulum to keep up
    * Pendulum will experience high high frequency force

## If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?
  * The pendulum displacement angle will remain unchanged.
    * The angle at the pivot point will move in a downward direction
  * The amplitude of oscillation could increase because of a reduced restoring force
    * Restoring force is weaker


## If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior?
